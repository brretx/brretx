I enjoy writing personal notes, mini-wikis, and reflections. I usually record them in Obsidian or my notebooks, but I’ve decided to publish them online in a blog format so my future self can easily find them.

Disclaimer: I chose to write in English because I want to improve my language skills. I will likely make mistakes with grammar, word choice, and so on; this is intentional. Over time, I will get better.

I plan to focus on topics such as books, programming, technology, learning, and personal reflections. This is purely a hobby—I don’t expect to gain anything from it except the joy of writing about things I love.
